# Features

**Status:** Active

## Overview

ɳTasks is a self-hosted, collaborative task management app. Built on a Flutter client and a Postgres + Hasura + Auth backend, it ships a deep feature set across list management, advanced todos, real-time collaboration, sharing, search/filtering, smart views, attachments, notifications, user preferences, and PWA install.

This page is the canonical inventory of every shipped capability. Each feature has a status, a one-line description, and (where relevant) configuration and usage notes. Status uses the master-list scheme: Active, Beta, Planned, Deprecated.

## Requirements

| Item | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Flutter | 3.7+ | Per `app/pubspec.yaml` |
| Backend stack | Required | `cd backend && make up` (Postgres + Hasura + Auth + Storage + MinIO + Mailpit) |
| Tier | Free | `task/` is free-plugins-only by design (per F03, F12) |
| Bundle | None | No paid bundle required |

## Configuration

Most feature configuration is in the Flutter app settings (per-user preferences) and in `backend/.env` (server-side defaults). The full env reference lives in [Backend Setup](Backend-Setup) and [Environment Variables](Environment-Variables).

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `nself` | Postgres database name |
| `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` | (set in `.env`) | Required to access the Hasura console |
| `AUTH_JWT_CUSTOM_CLAIMS` | (set in `.env`) | Custom JWT claims for app permissions |

## Known Issues

None currently tracked. Report issues at [github.com/nself-org/ntask/issues](https://github.com/nself-org/ntask/issues).

## Troubleshooting

### Backend services don't start

**Symptom:** `make up` fails or services exit immediately.
**Cause:** `.env` not created from `.env.example`, or required ports already in use.
**Fix:** `cd backend && cp .env.example .env`, then `lsof -i :8080,4000,8484,5432,9000` to free conflicting ports, then `make up` again.

### App can't reach Hasura

**Symptom:** GraphQL calls fail with network errors.
**Cause:** Backend not running, or app pointing at the wrong endpoint.
**Fix:** `cd backend && make health`. If healthy, verify the Flutter app's GraphQL endpoint matches the platform target (web typically uses `localhost:8080`, mobile sims may need the host machine IP).

### Hasura migrations not applied

**Symptom:** Tables missing or schema out of date.
**Cause:** Initial `init.sql` ran but Hasura YAML migrations weren't applied.
**Fix:** `cd backend && make migrate`. Confirm with `make migrate-status`.
