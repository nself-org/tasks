# Backend Setup

Step-by-step setup for the ɳTasks backend. The backend is a self-contained Docker Compose stack driven by a Makefile.

## Prerequisites

- Docker 20+ with Docker Compose v2
- GNU Make
- (Optional) Hasura CLI for migration management
- Free ports: 5432, 8080, 4000, 8484, 9000, 9001, 8025

## What You Get

- **PostgreSQL 16**: database
- **Hasura GraphQL Engine**: instant GraphQL API + console
- **Hasura Auth**: email + password JWT authentication
- **Hasura Storage**: S3-compatible upload and download API
- **MinIO**: object storage backend
- **Mailpit**: dev email capture (UI at `http://localhost:8025`)
- **Traefik**: HTTPS reverse proxy (only for staging and production profiles)

## Steps

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set:
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: strong password for Postgres
- `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET`: required to access the Hasura console
- `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET`: JSON object with key + algorithm (see `.env.example` for the format)
- Auth provider secrets (Google, GitHub, etc.) if you want OAuth

### 2. Start the stack

```bash
make up
```

This brings up Postgres, Hasura, Auth, Storage, MinIO, and Mailpit. First run pulls images and runs `postgres/init.sql` to create extensions, schemas, and application tables.

### 3. Verify health

```bash
make health
```

Expected output: all four checks (Postgres, Hasura, Auth, Storage) report OK.

### 4. Apply Hasura migrations

```bash
make migrate
```

Applies pending Hasura migrations from `backend/hasura/migrations/`. Run `make migrate-status` to see migration state.

### 5. Apply Hasura metadata

```bash
make metadata-apply
```

Applies tracked tables, relationships, permissions, and remote schemas from `backend/hasura/metadata/`.

### 6. (Optional) Seed sample data

```bash
make seed
```

Runs the seed script from the app side to populate sample lists and todos for local testing.

## Useful Commands

```bash
make up                  # start the stack
make down                # stop the stack
make restart             # restart everything
make logs                # tail logs from all services
make logs-hasura         # tail Hasura logs only
make logs-auth           # tail Auth logs only
make status              # docker compose ps
make health              # health endpoint check
make psql                # open a Postgres shell
make console             # open Hasura console (requires hasura-cli on host)
make migrate             # apply pending migrations
make migrate-status      # show migration state
make metadata-apply      # apply Hasura metadata
make metadata-export     # export current metadata
make backup              # dump Postgres to ./backups/backup-<timestamp>.sql
make restore FILE=...    # restore from a backup file
make staging-up          # start staging stack (Traefik HTTPS)
make staging-down        # stop staging stack
make prod-up             # start production stack
make prod-down           # stop production stack
make clean               # destroy containers + volumes (DESTRUCTIVE)
```

## Service Endpoints (local dev)

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Hasura GraphQL | `http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql` |
| Hasura Console | `http://localhost:8080/console` |
| Auth API | `http://localhost:4000` |
| Storage API | `http://localhost:8484` |
| MinIO Console | `http://localhost:9001` |
| Mailpit UI | `http://localhost:8025` |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` |

## Database Initialization

On first start, `backend/postgres/init.sql` runs automatically and creates:

- Required extensions (`uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`, `citext`)
- Schemas (`auth`, `storage`, `public`)
- Application tables (lists, todos, shares, presence, attachments)
- Indexes for query performance
- Triggers for `updated_at` timestamps
- Auto-profile creation on user signup

If you change `init.sql` after the first run, you must `make clean` and `make up` again, or run the new statements via `make psql`.

## Hasura Console

Visit `http://localhost:8080/console`. Use your `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` to authenticate.

The console gives you:

- Visual table editor and relationship builder
- GraphQL playground with schema explorer
- Permission manager (per role, per table, per operation)
- Migration tools (track tables, save migrations)
- Metadata management

## App Connection

The Flutter app under `app/` reads its backend endpoint from environment configuration. For local dev, the defaults match the Docker Compose ports above. Override via the app's environment file when running against staging or production.

For full app setup, see the root README under "App Setup".

## Alternative for nSelf CLI Users

If you already use the nSelf CLI elsewhere, you can substitute `nself start` against a generated config. The canonical, supported path for this repo, however, is `make up` against the included Compose files, since `task/` is the "any-stack" reference app and does not require the CLI.
